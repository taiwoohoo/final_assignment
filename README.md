This repository includes a Rmd, html file, best_artist.sqlite and README file.  Please read the README before running the code.
All the data collected is stored in best_artist.sqlite. If you want to call the data from the SQL, please replace the path with the location in your local machine to access it. 
For the Spotify API, if you want to run it by yourself, you will need to replace "???" with your own client ID, client secret, and token, which you can get in Spotify Web API.
